"How Soft The Shades of Evening Creep!"

How soft the shades of evening creep,
O'er yonder dewy lea,
Where balmy winds have lulled to sleep,
The tenents of the tree:

No wand'ring breeze is here to sweep,
In winding ripple, o'er the deep,
Yet swells the evening sea;

How calm the sky! Rest, ocean, rest,
From storm and ruffle free,
Calm as the image on thy breast
Of her that governs thee.
And yet beneath the moon's mild reign,
Thy broad breast heaves as one in pain,
Thou dark and silent sea.
