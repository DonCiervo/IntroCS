How Soft The Shades of Evening Creep

How soft the shades of evening creep
Oer yonder dewy lea
Where balmy winds have lulled to sleep
The tenents of the tree

No wandring breeze is here to sweep
In winding ripple oer the deep
Yet swells the evening sea

How calm the sky Rest ocean rest
From storm and ruffle free
Calm as the image on thy breast
Of her that governs thee
And yet beneath the moons mild reign
Thy broad breast heaves as one in pain
Thou dark and silent sea
