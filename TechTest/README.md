# Welcome to Intro CS

This Lab was created to test whether some applications necessary for successful
completion of the course are working.

Start by following these instructions.

## Check your Program

With check50 you are able to run checks on your program. We have provided
some checks which you can see by running the command below in your command line.

If a check is correct it will be displayed as green and if it doesn't it will 
be displayed as red. In this case the last check should fail i.e. be displayed in red.
Don't worry about it this is just for explanatory reasons.
