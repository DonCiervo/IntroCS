Why AOC Unleashed Her Fire Early
--------------------------------
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) had heard enough.Shortly after Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) vented about progressives nearly destroying the Democrats’ House majority in a strongly worded phone conversation with colleagues—one that instantly leaked to the press—Ocasio-Cortez decided she had to hit back, quickly and publicly. She immediately worked out an interview with New York Times and then with CNN.In interviews with The Daily Beast, multiple sources with knowledge of the newly re-elected congresswoman’s thinking said that the Saturday Q  the story was “definitely a reaction to Spanberger.”On Sunday, in an appearance on CNN, she said: “When we kind of come out swinging not 48 hours after Tuesday, and we don’t even have solid data yet, pointing fingers and telling each other what to do, it deepens the division in the party,” adding that, “It’s irresponsible to pour gasoline on what is already very delicate tensions in the party.”AOC: It’s Imperative that Biden Appoint Progressives in Key Cabinet PositionsMore fuel came pouring in from outside. On Saturday, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has long boosted Biden, told the same network: “The Democrats have to make it clear to the far left that they almost cost him this election,” prompting an instant rebuke from Ocasio-Cortez in defense of minority organizers who helped bag wins up and down the ballot.“A lot of what you’re seeing is jockeying for influence in the party,” the progressive aide said. “People are trying to shape the public opinion about how to read the results.”It’s a fight that feels particularly pressing, both to progressives and moderates, because of the upcoming special elections in Georgia, where Democrats are fighting for control of the Senate after what appears to be a slim victory there for Biden.“I think she’s extremely concerned about the tactics in Georgia because that’s still in the balance,” said Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez’s former chief of staff. “I think if Georgia wasn’t there I don’t know if this would have been a long-form interview,” he said about the Times.“I think it probably would have been some tweets or maybe wouldn’t have happened at all. It feels extremely high stakes.”They’re not the only stakes, however. When progressives largely agreed to join the far-flung coalition to defeat President Donald Trump, they signaled their intention, both in private and in public, to push Biden to the left “immediately” after the election—on everything from policy priorities to Cabinet picks. A third source familiar with Ocasio-Cortez’s thinking is now concerned that those forthcoming decisions in Bidenworld could be poorly impacted by the ripple effect from Spanberger’s remarks, hence the early and hot fire.“They can’t just keep belittling her and the squad and thinking what she says doesn’t matter,” said Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist, about moderates casting aside the New York representative’s concerns as illegitimate or too lofty. “She is the future.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

After an incarcerated firefighter was nearly killed on the frontlines, California delivered him to Ice
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bounchan Keola is facing deportation to Laos, a country he left when he was four, after helping to fight this year’s historic wildfiresCalifornia officials have transferred an incarcerated firefighter who suffered a near-death injury on the frontlines of a major blaze this fall to US immigration, and he is now threatened with deportation to a country his family fled three decades ago. Bounchan Keola, 39, had just two weeks left in his prison term when he was crushed by a tree while battling the destructive Zogg fire in northern California on 2 October and airlifted to a hospital. Days later, California prison officials notified federal immigration agents that his release would be coming up, and the state, records show, made arrangements to directly transfer him into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).Keola could now be deported to Laos, a country he left when he was four.“I just want to go home and give my mom and dad a hug,” Keola told the Guardian in a recent call from Ice detention. “All I know is I’m American. I’ve never thought of myself not being a citizen. I’m just asking for that one second chance.”Keola grew up a US permanent resident, and is the latest refugee to face deportation as a result of California’s controversial policy of transferring certain foreign-born prisoners to Ice after they’ve completed their prison sentences, a practice governor Gavin Newsom has supported. Lawmakers across the country, including congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called on Newsom to end the transfers in September, in response to the story of Kao Saelee, another prison firefighter and Laotian refugee sent to Ice.But the Democratic governor, it appears, has not budged. Battling blazes: ‘First time I felt free’Keola, born in 1981, has no memory of Laos. His family is of Khmu descent, an ethnic minority, and escaped the country after the Vietnam war. Keola has fragments of recollections of eating meals at a refugee camp in Thailand, and being terrified on the plane ride to the US.In San Leandro, California, where the family first resettled, Keola was afraid of attending school, unable to speak English. “I was scared of people with blue eyes and blond hair. I’d never seen those features.”He showed up to school without lunches and with clothes from Goodwill, he recalled, and was relentlessly bullied for being Asian and poor. He finally found community and protection when he met other Khmu youth in nearby Richmond, but that led him to start drinking in middle school, and he soon got caught up in gang violence. When he was 16, he was riding in a car with friends, and he and a group of them ended up shooting out of the vehicle at someone running toward them, afraid it was a member of a rival gang, he said. Two people were shot and one died.Keola was prosecuted as an adult and his mother begged him to accept a plea deal, afraid he would be locked away for life if he went to trial. So he agreed to plea to second-degree attempted murder and other serious charges, accepting 28 years. He said he has spent decades behind bars trying to right his wrongs: “I didn’t just harm the victim and his family – I hurt my family and my whole community,” he said. “I can’t take back what I did. But I can make amends and live differently and do whatever I can to help the next person.”This year, Keola got his first opportunity to give back outside of prison – as a worker on the frontlines of California’s fires, one of thousands of incarcerated people in the state battling blazes, making $3 a day, and $1 an hour when fighting fires.He knew people compared the work to “slave labor” given the meager wages, but he marveled at the chance to be outside, to put his hands in a river – his first time touching running water since he was a teenager. “There was no fence, no barbed-wire, no tower, nobody with a gun waiting for you. I felt free for the first time in 22 years.”When passersby honked in support and thanked them, he was stunned. “They treat us like firemen, not inmates. From then on, I knew this is what I was meant to do.”After years of criticisms that prison firefighters were barred from getting firefighting licenses once released, Governor Newsom signed legislation in September to allow some to have their criminal records expunged so they could join fire crews after prison. Newsom posed for bill-signing photos on land scorched by one of the fires, praising the “inmates who have stood on the frontlines, battling historic fires”.The legislation meant Keola, who was nearing the end of his sentence and getting early release due to his fire service, could have a shot at a real career. An injury, then a ‘betrayal’On 2 October, Keola and his crew were at the fast-spreading Zogg fire near Redding, clearing brush to stop the fire from spreading. Planes above were dumping water, making it hard for them to see, he recalled. Suddenly, he heard his crew members yelling, “Tree!” just before his head was hit and he was knocked down: “I was seeing stars. I couldn’t move. I was laying flat, facedown on the ground.”Keola had to be airlifted out. The rope hoisting him up got caught on a tree and he started rapidly spinning: “I was thinking, I’m gonna die. I started praying. I was like, God wants me to go. This is my time. I closed my eyes.”He survived. There were a handful of local news reports on the incident, mentioning two unnamed inmate firefighters suffering injuries.Keola’s release date was just two weeks away. He thought he might remain in the hospital until then, but instead he was sent back to prison, with recommendations for a follow up medical appointment the day before his release. His medical records list “traumatic neck injury”, and Keola wore a neck brace.In prison, he wasn’t treated or monitored by doctors, he said. Instead, he was placed in isolation: “I felt like I was being punished because I got hurt. I felt sad and betrayed.” (His records say he was in “quarantine”, suggesting he may have been isolated for Covid protocols.) He was taking ibuprofen everyday, trying to sleep on his stomach due to the pain.Meanwhile, his family, who lives in Pinole about 22 miles north-east of San Francisco, were making plans for his release. His sister, Thongsouk Keola, 36, said she took a week off work and planned to stay at a hotel near the prison so she could be outside waiting for him on the morning of 16 October.But two days prior, Ice agents told Keola their agency would be picking him up instead. His stomach started churning., he recalled.He rang his sister and told her not to bother coming.“It’s just so unfair. He has served for so many years,” Thongsouk said. “We know he is a different person now. We are here and ready and willing to take him in, and take all responsibility.” How Newsom could interveneThe California governor’s office has not responded to the Guardian’s repeated inquiries on the state’s policy of transferring prisoners to Ice. At one press conference, Newsom told a reporter it was “appropriate” and has “been done historically”.That’s despite the fact that the state has no legal obligation to collaborate with Ice and that California has a “sanctuary state” lawmeant to limit cooperation with immigration authorities and protect residents from deportation. Prison officials, however, say they comply with Ice’s “detainers”, meaning requests for people in custody who the federal government considers eligible for deportation.That includes longtime residents with green cards who are facing deportation due to convictions. Anoop Prasad, a staff attorney with the Asian Law Caucus (ALC), and Keola’s lawyer, said it’s unlikely federal agents would have known he was getting out if the state hadn’t alerted Ice.California has transferred more than 500 people from prison to Ice this year, according to ALC. Prasad and other activists have long been pushing for Newsom to end the policy altogether – and to issue pardons to people such as Keola and Saelee, which would mean they are no longer threatened with deportation.“Governor Newsom has pointed to pardons as a way to correct past injustices in the criminal system,” said Prasad. He noted that there is also no reason to believe any of this would change under the new administration of president-elect Joe Biden – who has signaled he would continue to deport people with criminal convictions. “It is not enough to just reverse what Donald Trump did. Governor Newsom has to take a hard look at the policies he’s adopted.”What’s more, the nation of Laos does not recognize the citizenship of Khmu refugees like Keola, so it’s unclear if his birth country would accept him. Still, he is facing deportation hearings, and Prasad and his family fear that Ice could find a way to deport him anyway.Spokespeople for the governor did not respond to repeated inquiries. Newsom has issued 63 pardons during his tenure, including ten this week to immigrants who would have faced deportation. Keola and Saelee were not on his list.A spokeswoman for the state corrections department said the agency “does not determine the immigration status of inmates” and that Ice “makes the determination of whether to put a hold or detainer on the inmate”. Keola, she said, was “released” on 16 October. The department declined to comment on Keola’s medical treatment.Ice did not respond to inquiries.In Ice, Keola’s neck pain is on and off. Doctors there told him it appeared he has kidney problems – and shouldn’t have been taking ibuprofen, he said.He has simple dreams about returning to his family. “I just want to help my mom clean, wash the dishes, do the laundry, even to water her garden. Play with my nephews and nieces. I just want to be there for them.”If he were to be deported, Keola has one request: that Ice at least let him out briefly so he has one chance to be with his elderly parents outside the walls of prison.

The New York Times ’ Misleading ‘Analysis’ of Benjamin Netanyahu
----------------------------------------------------------------
‘News Analysis,” a creative euphemism for “Opinion,” is deployed by outlets such as the New York Times and the Washington Post with increasing frequency. One of the Times’ recent offerings in this genre comes from Jerusalem bureau chief David Halbfinger, who writes that “Biden’s Win Means a Demotion for Netanyahu and Less Focus on Israel.” It’s an odd formulation. Benjamin Netanyahu has been Israel’s prime minister for over a decade, during presidencies of both parties. I suspect that the Times would consider treating other heads of state as inferior of the United States jingoistic in most other circumstances. But the opportunity to denigrate a conservative Israeli leader demands an exception.Halbfinger’s column-in-disguise has more problems than its title. He asserts that “Mr. Netanyahu’s stature on the global stage” has been “diminished.” He also approvingly quotes the critical Netanyahu biographer Anshel Pfeffer, who holds that “he’s gone from Trump’s wingman to the guy who polishes the canopy of the F-16.” He offers no evidence for these claims. Instead, as proof that Netanyahu is “unusually flummoxed” by Biden’s victory, he cites the fact that it took Netanyahu twelve hours after CNN and Fox News projected that Biden would become the 46th president of the United States to offer his congratulations on Twitter and that when he did, he did not by name reference the office of the presidency. Perhaps Halbfinger’s conception of being “flummoxed” differs from that of the rest of us.Halbfinger has a similarly unorthodox conception of what constitutes a “calming influence.” In his view, the agreements that the Trump administration has brokered between Israel and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kosovo, and Sudan are not signs of a more stable region. But he does believe that a Biden administration would somehow have a pacifying effect. Especially if it responded to other Arab states’ expressing an interest in formalizing relations with the world’s only Jewish state by urging them to ask for more concessions from Israel in the Palestinian conflict. His idea of a balanced approach, then, entails the United States urging one of two willing parties in question not to agree to a deal unless one of the two provides more benefits to an unwilling fourth party. Got that?Later in the column, Halbfinger credulously entertains an unsubstantiated hypothetical scenario from Pfeffer in which Biden would invite “Mr. Netanyahu’s rivals, Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, to Washington for high-profile meetings while snubbing the prime minister.” Similarly, he quotes a former adviser to former prime minister Shimon Peres, who speculated that Biden might say, “The party’s over. I don’t want to fight with you, but I intend to stabilize the situation, and you’re going to help me. Forget about annexation. No surprises. No unilateral anything. And I need something constructive from you as well: Make it easier to shore up the Palestinian Authority before it collapses, and Gaza before it explodes. And I promise you I’ll bring you into the room when I’m discussing Iran.” Neither hypothetical is subject to qualification from Halfbinger. Bibi will just have to do as Uncle Joe tells him, of course — “the party’s over.”Most mainstream journalists tend to be sharply critical of Netanyahu, whom they characterize as fond of — as Halbfinger does in his piece — “divisive political tactics, denunciations of ‘fake news’ and playing to working-class voters’ resentments.” Netanyahu is a flawed man with no shortage of words and actions one can quibble with. But he has deftly guided Israel through every crisis it has faced during his tenure while — contrary to his political opponents’ portrayal of him — operating as a pragmatist rather than a winger. Netanyahu knows there will be no good-faith negotiation with the current crop of Palestinian leaders. But with Arab leaders spooked by the Obama administration’s absurd and illogical embrace of the Iranian regime, he saw an opportunity for rapprochement and took it.The Left’s instinctive contempt for figures such as Netanyahu of course results in biased writing. But perhaps even worse is that it leads to inaccurate and unbalanced analysis. This is particularly true of columns labeled “News Analysis,” which are habitually shrill and lacking in insight. Unfortunately, a few hysterical quotes from the expert class, who tend to share the opinion of the author, can suffice to gain this designation and the patina of objectivity that comes with it. Netanyahu’s time as prime minister may well be coming to an end. He has, after all, held the position for nearly twelve years. But the idea that Donald Trump’s loss will bring it about is the stuff of the New York Times editorial board’s fantasies, not of sober analysis.
