Sen. Lankford Says He Will Intervene if Trump Doesn’t Begin Transition by Friday
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Senator James Lankford (R., Okla.) on Wednesday said it’s important for people who voted for President Trump to have “all of their questions answered” regarding unfounded claims of voter fraud, though he issued assurance that there would be a peaceful transition of power, and vowed to intervene if the administration doesn't begin cooperating with the transition.“It is important for the 71-million plus people that voted for President Trump that at the end of it, they know all of their questions were answered," Lankford told KRMG, "And that there is a president that was actually duly elected.”President Trump has repeatedly vowed to contest election results in a number of battleground state won by President-elect Joe Biden. In Georgia, a recount is being undertaken by hand. However, election officials from both parties in a number of states have said they have not seen any evidence of widespread voting irregularities.The junior senator from Oklahoma told KRMG despite the recount it is unlikely that the projected results will be overturned.He also told the radio station that he would intervene if the Trump administration has not given Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by week's end."There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that," said Lankford, who is on the Senate Oversight Committee.If no progress has been made by Friday toward the President-elect receiving the highly classified intelligence briefings on national security issues, he says he plans to step in and say, "This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task."On Monday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the Democrat has not received the briefing because the election has not been definitively called by the General Services Administration yet. For his part, Biden has said that the daily briefings "would be useful, but it's not necessary."Lankford defended both Trump's legal actions against unfounded allegations of voter fraud and Biden's ability to receive the briefings in saying, "Joe Biden can continue to be able to function and say, 'I'm the president-elect,' and great if you want to say that, go do it, and to be able to do your preparation work. The President can say, 'Not so fast. I've got questions to answer.' Great, go ask them."Regardless of the final result, Lankford said is confident in the election system and does not anticipate there will be violence.“I can assure you there will be a peaceful transition of power in the United States,” Lankford said.Republican Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas made similar statements to Lankford's on Tuesday, and Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said Wednesday that the transition should be allowed to begin since "we're on a path it looks likely Joe Biden is going to be the next president of the United States."

Why AOC Unleashed Her Fire Early
--------------------------------
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) had heard enough.Shortly after Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) vented about progressives nearly destroying the Democrats’ House majority in a strongly worded phone conversation with colleagues—one that instantly leaked to the press—Ocasio-Cortez decided she had to hit back, quickly and publicly. She immediately worked out an interview with New York Times and then with CNN.In interviews with The Daily Beast, multiple sources with knowledge of the newly re-elected congresswoman’s thinking said that the Saturday Q  the story was “definitely a reaction to Spanberger.”On Sunday, in an appearance on CNN, she said: “When we kind of come out swinging not 48 hours after Tuesday, and we don’t even have solid data yet, pointing fingers and telling each other what to do, it deepens the division in the party,” adding that, “It’s irresponsible to pour gasoline on what is already very delicate tensions in the party.”AOC: It’s Imperative that Biden Appoint Progressives in Key Cabinet PositionsMore fuel came pouring in from outside. On Saturday, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has long boosted Biden, told the same network: “The Democrats have to make it clear to the far left that they almost cost him this election,” prompting an instant rebuke from Ocasio-Cortez in defense of minority organizers who helped bag wins up and down the ballot.“A lot of what you’re seeing is jockeying for influence in the party,” the progressive aide said. “People are trying to shape the public opinion about how to read the results.”It’s a fight that feels particularly pressing, both to progressives and moderates, because of the upcoming special elections in Georgia, where Democrats are fighting for control of the Senate after what appears to be a slim victory there for Biden.“I think she’s extremely concerned about the tactics in Georgia because that’s still in the balance,” said Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez’s former chief of staff. “I think if Georgia wasn’t there I don’t know if this would have been a long-form interview,” he said about the Times.“I think it probably would have been some tweets or maybe wouldn’t have happened at all. It feels extremely high stakes.”They’re not the only stakes, however. When progressives largely agreed to join the far-flung coalition to defeat President Donald Trump, they signaled their intention, both in private and in public, to push Biden to the left “immediately” after the election—on everything from policy priorities to Cabinet picks. A third source familiar with Ocasio-Cortez’s thinking is now concerned that those forthcoming decisions in Bidenworld could be poorly impacted by the ripple effect from Spanberger’s remarks, hence the early and hot fire.“They can’t just keep belittling her and the squad and thinking what she says doesn’t matter,” said Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist, about moderates casting aside the New York representative’s concerns as illegitimate or too lofty. “She is the future.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Republican backpedals after saying he’d ‘step in’ if Biden doesn’t receive briefings
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Senator James Lankford said ‘no loss’ from Biden receiving intelligence briefings but later tweeted support for baseless voter fraud claims  * US politics – live updatesA Republican senator backpedaled on Twitter Wednesday night after telling a local Oklahoma radio station he would “step in” if Joe Biden did not begin receiving daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week.In an interview with local KRMG, first picked up by the Hill, the Oklahoma senator James Lankford was asked what he thought of the refusal by the office of the director of national intelligence to brief the president-elect until another arm of the bureaucracy certified Biden’s victory.“There is no loss from him getting the briefings, and to be able to do that,” said Lankford. “And if that’s not occurring by Friday, I will step in as well, and to be able to push and to say this needs to occur, so that regardless of the outcome of the election ... people can be ready for that actual task.”In his suggestion that the “outcome of the election” was still in doubt, Lankford made himself an ally to Donald Trump’s cause of overturning the election or, failing that, spoiling public faith in it, as a means of weakening Biden.Yet apparently under pressure to clarify that he did not mean to suggest that Biden might have won, Lankford later tweeted support for the president’s pursuit of baseless voter fraud accusations.“President @realDonaldTrump is fully in his right to ask for recounts and for every legal question to be fully vetted and resolved,” Lankford wrote. “It is important for the 71 million Americans that voted for President Trump that at the end of all this their questions are answered.”The failure of elected Republicans to admit Biden won the election and to contradict Trump’s false accusations of voter fraud is allowing those accusations to flourish and persuading new voters every hour that the 2020 election – and by extension American democracy – is illegitimate, analysts say.The presidential transition process is stalled, meanwhile, with Biden aides shut out of office space, vetting of Biden appointees unable to begin and Biden himself excluded from the presidential daily briefing.It has been the custom of the White House to share the presidential daily briefing with the president-elect during the transition period ever since the advent of the briefing in the 1960s, David Priess, the author of a book on presidential briefings, told NPR. The briefing contain intelligence findings and analysis of potential threats and opportunities.Trump himself began to receive daily intelligence briefings soon after the 2016 election, but then revealed he usually skipped them, believing he did not need them, explaining on Fox News: “You know, I’m, like, a smart person.”An open letter signed by four former homeland security secretaries from both parties warned on Wednesday that delaying the presidential transition endangered the country.“At this period of heightened risk for our nation, we do not have a single day to spare to begin the transition,” the letter said. “For the good of the nation, we must start now.”Former House intelligence committee chair Mike Rogers, a Republican from Michigan, echoed the warning.“Our adversaries aren’t waiting for the transition to take place,” Rogers tweeted. “Joe Biden should receive the President’s Daily Brief (PDB) starting today. He needs to know what the latest threats are   this is about national security.”When asked Tuesday about the daily briefings, Biden himself, who served in the senate for 36 years before serving for eight years as vice-president, called them nice but not, for the moment, necessary.“Obviously the PDB would be useful, but it’s not necessary,” Biden said. “I’m not the sitting president now.”
